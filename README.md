# Web application for 'De Turfschuur'
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
The 'Turfschuur' is a building – located in Groningen, The Netherlands – which is being used foor room rental. For the final project of the cs50 course i decided to help out this building by making a web application by which the volunteers, that make the renting of this building possible, can log in and store every renter inside a calender and even generate an invoice.

It's still a work in progress.
